# variational-jumps
Theoretical and numerical study of jump transitions in constrained variational evolution problems.

This repository hosts numerical simulations, Jupyter notebooks, and LaTeX documents supporting the analysis of jump transitions in variational evolution problems, with a particular focus on crack propagation in heterogeneous toughness settings.

## Overview

- **LaTeX** source for papers and technical notes.
- **Python scripts** for numerical simulations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** demonstrating and visualising jump evolution criteria.
